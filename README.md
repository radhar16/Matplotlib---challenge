# Matplotlib---challenge
Matplotlib Homework

* The data for any mouse ID with duplicate time points was identified and the associated data were removed by using duplicated() and drop_duplicates() methods.

* A summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen using summary statistical methods - mean(), median(), var(), std(), and
  SEM methods. Also .agg() method produce same results of mean, median, var , std and SEM.

* A bar plot using both Pandas's `DataFrame.plot()` and Matplotlib's `pyplot` were generated that shows the total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.

* A pie plot using both Pandas's `DataFrame.plot()` and Matplotlib's `pyplot` were generated that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.

* The quartiles and IQR were determined quantitatively and the potential outliers were identified across all four treatment regimens ['Capomulin','Ramicane', 'Infubinol', 'Ceftamin'].

* A box plot was generated to plot the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens.The potential outliers were highlighted in the plot by changing their color and style by using dict(markerfacecolor='r',    
  marker='D') method with the help from documentation (https://matplotlib.org/gallery/pyplots/boxplot_demo_pyplot.html#sphx-glr-gallery-pyplots-boxplot-demo-pyplot-py).

* A mice sample was used to create a line plot for tumor volume vs. time point treated with Capomulin regimen. 

* A scatter plot was generated for mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

* The correlation coefficient was calculated using pearson r formaula. The linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment were determined and the linear regression 
  was plotted on top of the previous scatter plot.

  Documentation:

  Matplotlib topics covered in the classes helped to calculate quartiles, correlation and linear regression. Also, the various plots and charts were useful to visualize the data. 
  Websites such as Stack overflow, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ and https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials were used for reference.
